<h1> Utilizing python and AI in building smart home IOT with Home Assistant and Wemos </h1><br />
    Smart home IOT has come a long way in the past few years. From simple motion sensors and basic automation to complex AI-driven smart home systems, there's no shortage of options available. However, one of the most powerful tools for setting up a powerful and automated DIY smart home is the open source Home Assistant (Hassio) software.<br />
<br />
Home Assistant is a tool that allows you to control and monitor all the devices in your home from one single place. It allows you to easily integrate different protocols, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and more, to connect all your devices and make them work together. Home Assistant also supports the integration of AI through services such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa.<br />
<br />
In this article, I will show you how to use Python and Home Assistant to create a powerful and automated DIY IOT setup with AI. We will be using the Wemos D1 mini and NodeMCU as the base hardware, and Python as the language for writing the automation scripts.<br />
<br />
We will start by understanding the basics of Home Assistant and the Wemos D1 mini. We will then look at how to set up a basic automation using Home Assistant and the Wemos D1 mini. We will then look at how we can use Python with Home Assistant to create more complex automations. Finally, we will look at how to add AI to our setup using services such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa.<br />
<br />
By the end of this article, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use Python and Home Assistant to create a powerful and automated DIY IOT setup with AI.</body>
